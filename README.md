# Hindsight - Code Time Travel IDE

A VS Code extension that automatically saves code snapshots and enables time-travel debugging with 20/20 hindsight.

## Current Status: Phase 4 Complete âœ…

- âœ… Phase 1: File Watching
- âœ… Phase 2: Snapshot System
- âœ… Phase 3: Time Travel UI
- âœ… Phase 4: Visual Diff Viewer

## Phase 1: Basic Extension & File Watcher âœ…

### What We Built
- VS Code extension that monitors file changes in your workspace
- File watcher that detects creates, changes, and deletes
- Basic commands to start/stop watching and view status

### How to Test the Extension

1. **Open this project in VS Code** (you're probably already here!)

2. **Press F5** (or go to Run â†’ Start Debugging)
   - This will open a new VS Code window titled **"Extension Development Host"**
   - Your Hindsight extension will be running in that window

3. **In the Extension Development Host window:**
   - Open any folder/project
   - You should see a notification: "Hindsight is now watching your code!"

4. **Test file watching:**
   - Create or edit any file in the workspace
   - Look at the bottom status bar - you should see "Hindsight: filename.ext changed" messages
   - Try these commands (Cmd+Shift+P or Ctrl+Shift+P):
     - **Hindsight: Show Status** - See how many files have changed
     - **Hindsight: Stop Watching** - Stop tracking changes
     - **Hindsight: Start Watching** - Resume tracking

5. **View logs:**
   - In the Extension Development Host window, open the Debug Console
   - You'll see console logs like `[Hindsight] File changed: src/app.ts`

â””â”€â”€ .hindsight/                 # Snapshot storage (created in workspace)
    â””â”€â”€ snapshots/              # Individual snapshot JSON files
```

### What It Does Right Now

- âœ… Detects when files are created, modified, or deleted
- âœ… Filters out irrelevant files (node_modules, .git, etc.)
- âœ… Shows notifications in status bar
- âœ… Logs all changes to console
- âœ… Tracks statistics (number of changes)

## Phase 2: Snapshot System âœ…

### What We Built
- `.hindsight/` folder structure for storing snapshots
- SnapshotManager class for creating/saving/loading snapshots
- Automatic snapshot creation on file save/create
- JSON-based storage with timestamps and metadata
- "List Snapshots" command to browse history

### Features Added
- âœ… Snapshot creation with unique IDs
- âœ… File content capture with metadata
- âœ… Persistent storage in JSON format
- âœ… Quick Pick UI for browsing snapshots

## Phase 3: Time Travel UI âœ…

### What We Built
- Interactive webview panel for visualizing snapshot timeline
- Beautiful UI with VS Code theme integration
- Click snapshots to view file contents
- Real-time message passing between extension and UI
- Refresh functionality to update timeline

### How to Use
1. **Open the Time Travel Panel:**
   - Press Cmd+Shift+P (Mac) or Ctrl+Shift+P (Windows)
   - Type "Hindsight: Open Time Travel"
   - A new panel will open showing your snapshot timeline

2. **Browse Snapshots:**
   - See all snapshots in chronological order (newest first)
   - Each card shows: timestamp, trigger type, and files changed

3. **View Snapshot Details:**
   - Click any snapshot card
   - View the complete file content at that point in time
   - See file sizes and metadata

### Features Added
- âœ… Custom webview panel with HTML/CSS/JavaScript
- âœ… Timeline visualization with snapshot cards
- âœ… Click to view snapshot details
- âœ… Display file contents in code blocks
- âœ… VS Code theme integration (dark/light mode support)
- âœ… Refresh button to update timeline

## Phase 4: Visual Diff Viewer âœ…

### What We Built
- Side-by-side diff comparison between any two snapshots
- Visual highlighting for added/removed/unchanged lines
- Compare mode in timeline panel
- Separate diff viewer webview panel
- Uses the `diff` library for intelligent line-by-line comparison

### How to Use
1. **Open Timeline Panel:**
   - Run "Hindsight: Open Time Travel" command

2. **Enter Compare Mode:**
   - Click "Compare Mode" button in the timeline
   - Title changes to "Compare Snapshots - Select OLD then NEW"

3. **Select Snapshots to Compare:**
   - Click first snapshot (marked as "OLD")
   - Click second snapshot (marked as "NEW")
   - Diff viewer opens automatically in a new panel

4. **View the Diff:**
   - Green lines = Added content
   - Red lines = Removed content
   - White/gray lines = Unchanged content
   - Files shown with status badges (ADDED, DELETED, MODIFIED)

### Features Added
- âœ… Diff algorithm integration (using `diff` npm package)
- âœ… Line-by-line comparison with color coding
- âœ… Compare mode toggle in timeline
- âœ… Two-step selection (OLD â†’ NEW)
- âœ… Separate diff viewer panel
- âœ… File status indicators (added/deleted/modified)
- âœ… Unchanged files are filtered out
- âœ… HTML escaping for safe code display
- âœ… Before/After snapshot metadata display

## Development Commands

```

## Learning Notes

### Key Concepts Learned

**Phase 1:**
- VS Code Extension Structure: package.json, activation events, commands
- TypeScript Compilation: .ts â†’ .js with source maps
- File System Watching: VS Code's FileSystemWatcher API
- Event Listeners: onDidChange, onDidCreate, onDidDelete

**Phase 2:**
- File I/O Operations: fs.promises.readFile, writeFile, readdir
- Async/Await: Asynchronous programming in TypeScript
- JSON Storage: Serialization and deserialization
- Date Handling: ISO strings, timestamp generation

**Phase 3:**
- VS Code Webview API: Custom UI panels
- HTML/CSS in extensions: Building interfaces
- Message Passing: Extension â†” Webview communication
- Event Handling: User interactions in webviews

**Phase 4:**
- Diff Algorithms: Line-by-line text comparison
- NPM Package Integration: Using external libraries
- Multi-panel Coordination: Managing multiple webviews
- State Management: Toggle modes and selections
- Visual Feedback: Color-coded diffs and status badges

- **fileWatcher.ts**: File change detection and snapshot triggering
- **snapshotManager.ts**: Snapshot creation, storage, and retrieval
- **timelinePanel.ts**: Webview panel for time travel UI with compare mode
- **diffViewer.ts**: Diff comparison webview panel
